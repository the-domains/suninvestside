### ELYSIUM     PROPERTY DESCRIPTION

### **INSPIRED BY A MEDITERRANEAN SPIRIT**

Elysium, which is located right next to our recently and successfully completed project Inspirit, is designed with an aspiration for excellence. Planned on a large plot of land at 14,400 m² with only 22% building density utilized out of the permitted 25%, the project evokes a feeling of spaciousness. The landscaped gardens seamlessly blend with the green natural surroundings. The project encompasses only 40 apartments and 8 luxury semi-detached villas spread across 9 south facing low-rise blocks.

This luxury retreat is in Side's most rapidly emerging neighborhoods "Ilica". On a gently sloping site elevated 36 meters above sea level, it is outlined by exquisite gardens designed to encourage an outdoor lifestyle where one can experience and enjoy the true spirit of the Turkish Mediterranean -- welcoming, outdoor orientated, informal and tranquil.

### SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE...

Elysium offers a variety of unit configurations ranging from contemporary two-bedroom apartments to four-bedroom luxury semi-detached villas. Each unit has been thoroughly designed to offer space saving solutions to suit different family needs.

The versatile design harnesses washes of natural light to promote the perfect blend of openness and privacy. Built-in mirrored wardrobes contribute to the feeling of spaciousness. Concealed LED ceiling strip lights enhance the overall luxurious finish and create a special ambience in the evenings.

Generously sized rooms with lacquered white doors, modern porcelain floor tiles, built-in cloakrooms, classy kitchen units and many more intricate details contribute to the ultimate luxurious finish.

### 2 BEDROOM GARDEN APARTMENTS

The apartments incorporate an open plan living room, two elegantly designed bedrooms, an en-suite bathroom and a family bathroom. All apartments have large terraces adjoining the private gardens. The south facing front gardens enjoy views of the exquisite landscaping and the swimming pool.

### OUTDOOR LIVING IN A SERENE ENVIRONMENT

The use of split level elevated gardens for the ground floor apartments give each home an element of privacy. The 40 metre main swimming area and the 24m² children's pool surrounded by a wooden deck terrace ensure an enjoyable day at the pool for all. The carefully designed Mediterranean Café-bar provides a fine ambiance and a cool relaxation spot.

### ELYSIUM CLUB AND ON-SITE FACILITIES

Residents will be spoilt for choice with a plethora of facilities and modern indulgences offered at the complex. Elysium accommodates a 61 m² heated indoor pool for the exclusive use of the residents. The fully equipped fitness centre, sauna and large multi-purpose room for yoga, Pilates or dance classes will help residents to fulfil their lifestyle needs throughout their stay.

### SERVICED APARTMENT CONCEPT

The 'serviced apartment' concept entails a fully managed site with pool and garden maintenance plus 24-hours-security and housekeeping on request. Buy-to-let investors can enjoy the highest ROI, thanks to the services offered in addition to extensive on-site amenities.

### GARDENS

The gardens of Elysium are surely one of the most outstanding features of this unique development. Discreet outdoor lighting on the pathways, inside the pools and around the retaining walls of the elevated gardens ensures a special ambience on balmy summer evenings.

The retaining walls will be covered by charming purple and white Bougainvillea flowers and will provide a colourful contrast against the contemporary facades. A beautiful orchard of mixed fruit trees including orange, lemon & peach will enhance the Mediterranean feeling. The Elysium Café will have a stylish terrace overlooking the pool where you can enjoy your cocktails. Parking will be near the two main entrances providing plenty of spaces for everyone.
