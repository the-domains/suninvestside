Agora is a luxurious residential development consisting of 99 apartments of various sizes built on a large landscaped area of 11,480 m². The architecture of AGORA represents a modern Mediterranean style enhanced with the use of partial wood cladding on white washed walls.

## Private sun terraces

The landscaped gardens of Agora are surely one of the most outstanding features of this unique development. One of the creative features is the private sunbathing areas around the nicely sized outdoor pool. Privacy is enhanced by level variations and landscaped garden areas placed between each of them.

## Silence pool

In addition to the large 270 m² outdoor pool, there is a second pool of 90 m², This second pool will be a designated 'silence pool' with no children allowed for those who would like to enjoy some serenity amongst beautifully landscaped gardens.

## Flexible interiors

Flexibility & individuality have been the key concepts in the design of the apartments in order to answer the varying demand of discerning buyers. The apartments and the duplex penthouses offer different sized options.  
Four-bedroom duplex penthouses additionally offer the option of converting one of the two bedrooms on the entrance floor into a large separate kitchen, therefore also enjoying a larger living room area.  
Privacy has been maximised by the use of noise reducing 25 cm thick brick walls between neighbouring apartments. Separator walls between terraces grant ultimate privacy whilst enjoying your own outdoor space.

## Terrace gardens

Generously sized terraces follow the full length of the main facade, combined with large openings, reflect an outward lifestyle owing to the climate recording 300 days of sunshine a year.  
The flower gardens on the terraces on each floor enhance the green aspect of the whole development, lending a Mediterranean charm to the modern architecture.  
The flower gardens will be equipped with an innovative automatic watering system as well as hidden drainage pipes, hence minimising required maintenance.

## Facilities & the Serviced apartment concept

The site will offer 5 star amenities to its residents such as a 33 m long / 270 m² outdoor pool surrounded by a large deck containing private wooden sun terraces & a pool bar/restaurant with Wi-Fi internet.  
There will also be an exceptionally large children's pool and play area, a 'silence pool' of 90 m², an indoor pool with a wave feature, a game room with billiards, dart & foosball, a fully equipped gym, sauna & steam room.  
The 'serviced apartment' concept entails a fully managed site with pool & garden maintenance plus 24-hours-security and housekeeping on request. Buy-to-let investors can enjoy highest returns on their investment, thanks to the services offered in addition to the site's prime location and views.

## Landscaping

The landscaped gardens of Agora are surely one of the most outstanding features of this unique development. One of the most creative features is the private sunbathing areas around the nicely sized outdoor pool. Privacy is enhanced by level variations and landscaped garden areas placed between each of them. The second outdoor pool is a designated 'silence pool' for those who prefer serenity within the beautifully landscaped gardens.  
Over 40 trees will be planted within the lawned gardens which include olive, orange, lemon and blackberry trees as well as the pretty Jacaranda trees with their purple flowers colouring the pool areas. The meter-high stone masonry retaining walls will be covered by the charming Bougainvilleas of purple and white.  
Picnic tables and hammocks scattered in the gardens will be there for disposal of the residents. The Pool bar will have a stylish terrace overlooking the pool where you can enjoy cocktails and delicious snacks. The monumental entrance gate offers an impressive vista over the generously sized pool and carefully landscaped garden areas. Terrace gardens also enhance the 'green' aspect of the development.
